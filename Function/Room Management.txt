Perfect 👏 — this version of your **Room Management UI** is clean, professional, and very well structured. You’ve clearly applied all best practices.

Now, let’s go through a **complete explanation** of every element and function in your updated Room Management form — so you’ll know exactly what each part does, what data it affects, and how it connects to your Tenant Registration form.

# 🏠 **ROOM MANAGEMENT (Updated UI) – COMPLETE FUNCTION EXPLANATION**

Your form is designed to let the **Admin** manage all the boarding rooms —
create new rooms, update details, track status, monitor occupancy, and archive old records.

---

## 🧩 **A. FORM PURPOSE**

The **Room Management form** allows the admin to:

* Add new rooms
* Set the rent and deposit per room
* Track which rooms are available, occupied, or under maintenance
* Automatically count how many tenants are in each room
* Archive old rooms without deleting them

This form directly supports the **Tenant Registration module** — since all room info here (rent, deposit, type, status) is used when registering tenants.

---

## 🧱 **B. INPUT FIELDS (Top Section)**

Let’s break down each field:

---

### 🏷️ **1. Room Number**

📘 **Purpose:**
Unique identifier of each room (like “101”, “2A”, “3B”).

💡 **How It Works:**

* Admin enters a new room number here when creating a room.
* Used by the Tenant Registration form to assign tenants.
* Must be **unique** — two rooms cannot have the same number.

⚙️ **Example:**
If you enter “101”, the system saves it as “Room 101” in the database.

---

### 👥 **2. Capacity**

📘 **Purpose:**
The maximum number of tenants that can stay in this room.

💡 **How It Works:**

* Helps the system track when the room is full.
* The system can compare **Capacity** vs **Current Occupants** to update the **Status** automatically.

⚙️ **Example:**
If Capacity = 2 and Current Occupants = 2 → system sets Status = “Occupied”.

---

### 🏠 **3. Room Type**

📘 **Purpose:**
Defines the type of room, which affects rent and deposit amounts.

💡 **How It Works:**

* The admin selects from a dropdown (Single / Double / Shared).
* When you set this, you can define rent and deposit values according to the room type.
* Tenant Registration uses this field to **auto-fill the deposit and rent**.

⚙️ **Example:**
Single Room → ₱3,000
Double Room → ₱2,000
Shared Room → ₱1,500

---

### 🪟 **4. Description**

📘 **Purpose:**
Stores short notes about the room for admin reference.

💡 **How It Works:**
Optional text field for extra info such as:

* “With aircon and CR”
* “Good for students”
* “Needs repair”

⚙️ **Example:**
Description: “2 beds, with balcony”

---

### 💰 **5. Rent Price**

📘 **Purpose:**
The monthly rent amount for this room.

💡 **How It Works:**

* Set by the admin manually based on room type and size.
* Displayed automatically in Tenant Registration when this room is chosen.
* Used in payment computation (rent collection).

⚙️ **Example:**
Rent Price: ₱3,500 per month.

---

### 💵 **6. Monthly Deposit**

📘 **Purpose:**
The security deposit amount required for this room.

💡 **How It Works:**

* Defined once by the admin here.
* Tenant Registration automatically loads this deposit when a tenant is assigned to this room.
* Usually equal to or one month of rent.

⚙️ **Example:**
Monthly Deposit: ₱3,500.
When a tenant selects Room 101, Tenant Registration shows “Required Deposit: ₱3,500”.

---

### 🔄 **7. Status**

📘 **Purpose:**
Shows the current availability of the room.

💡 **How It Works:**

* Dropdown with three options:

  * **Available** – Room is empty and ready for tenants.
  * **Occupied** – Full capacity reached (auto-updated when tenant added).
  * **Maintenance** – Temporarily unavailable.

⚙️ **Example:**
When all occupants leave, admin sets Status = Available again.

---

### 👤 **8. Current Occupants**

📘 **Purpose:**
Displays how many tenants are currently staying in the room.

💡 **How It Works:**

* This field is **read-only**.
* It updates automatically whenever a tenant is added or removed in Tenant Registration.

⚙️ **Example:**
Capacity = 2, Occupants = 1 → 1 slot left.
Once 2 tenants are assigned → field shows 2, and Status auto-updates to “Occupied”.

---

---

## 🧭 **C. ACTION BUTTONS (Middle Section)**

### 🟩 **Add Room**

📘 **Purpose:**
Creates a new room record in the system.

💡 **How It Works:**

* Takes all the entered field values (Room Number, Type, Rent, Deposit, etc.).
* Saves them to the database.
* Refreshes the table below.

⚙️ **Example:**
Clicking “Add Room” after entering Room Number = 101, Rent = ₱3500, Deposit = ₱3500 →
New record appears in the grid.

---

### 🟨 **Update Room**

📘 **Purpose:**
Allows the admin to edit details of an existing room.

💡 **How It Works:**

* Select a room record from the table.
* Modify any field (e.g., rent, status, description).
* Click “Update Room” to save changes.

⚙️ **Example:**
Change “Rent Price” from ₱3,500 → ₱4,000, click Update Room.

---

### 📦 **Archive Room**

📘 **Purpose:**
Safely removes the room from the active list (without deleting it permanently).

💡 **How It Works:**

* Marks the room as “Archived” in the database.
* The record disappears from the active table but can be viewed later in an “Archived Rooms” list.
* Useful when a room is permanently closed or repurposed.

⚙️ **Example:**
Room 202 is under renovation → click “Archive Room”.

---

### 🧹 **Clear Fields**

📘 **Purpose:**
Clears all textboxes and resets dropdowns.

💡 **How It Works:**

* Makes it easy to add a new room after editing one.
* Does not affect any saved data.

⚙️ **Example:**
After updating a record, click “Clear Fields” to start fresh.

---

---

## 🔎 **D. SEARCH, SORT, & FILTER (Middle Toolbar)**

Would you like me to create a **visual flowchart** showing how your **Room Management and Tenant Registration** forms interact —
(e.g., Room → Tenant → Status Update → Occupants Auto-Count)?
It would be perfect for documentation or system presentation.
